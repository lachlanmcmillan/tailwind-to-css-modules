# tailwind-to-css-modules

Turn tailwind classes into CSS modules.

Limitations:
 - **Only implemented for jsx/tsx files**
 - doesn't handle media queries / breakpoints

To install dependencies:

```bash
bun install
```

To run:

```bash
bun start myfile.tsx
```

Or

```bash
bun start ./src
```

This project was created using `bun init` in bun v1.0.28. [Bun](https://bun.sh) is a fast all-in-one JavaScript runtime.
